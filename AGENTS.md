# AGENTS.md

## Scope
This repo is the expert-pack content layer for Forge 1.20.1: KubeJS recipes/gates, quest content, config balancing, and validation tooling.

## Headlining Systems
- Bounded matter economy: geological deposits, Y-band locality, processing ladders.
- Dual crafting spines: Tinkers/Create tech spine and Blood Magic-parented magic spine.
- Adventure spine: obelisks/dimensions/combat feeding progression.
- Coin + villager/wares economy as a core progression lane.
- Local logistics thesis: trains/physical logistics first, AE2 local, OC2R intersite.
- Pillager campaign pressure as ongoing surface threat.
- Body systems loop: food, water quality, nutrition, and still-beating-heart bridge into Blood Magic.
- Tiered machine casing progression across mods.

## Source Of Truth
The repo is the authoritative content layer, not a live Minecraft instance. Treat these as source:
- `kubejs/`
- `config/`
- `defaultconfigs/`
- `datapacks/`
- `globalresources/`
- `resourcepacks/`
- `shaderpacks/`
- `mods/*.pw.toml`
- custom bundled jars in `mods/`
- `docs/` summaries, audits, plans, and current validation reports
- `tools/`

Treat these as generated or runtime state:
- `server-instance/`
- `server-template/`
- local client game directories
- `generated/pack-site/`, `generated/runtime-dumps/`, `generated/mod-sync-backup/`, `generated/ftbquests/`
- worlds, saves, logs, crash reports, screenshots, profiler dumps, launcher account/cache files, and `options.txt`

Do not sync or delete player/runtime state by default. Use explicit reset flags only when the user asks for a disposable runtime.

## Runtime Defaults
- Minecraft: `1.20.1`
- Forge: `47.4.13`
- Local server port: `25566`
- Offline local testing usernames are allowed for agent validation.

## Where To Work
- `kubejs/server_scripts/`: progression and recipe overrides (authoritative)
- `kubejs/startup_scripts/`: startup hooks only
- `config/`, `defaultconfigs/`: mod behavior + server/world defaults
- `docs/`: audits, plans, validation evidence
- `tools/`: test/profiling/worldgen harness scripts
- `server-instance/`: generated dedicated server runtime; sync from source before launching

## Sync And Launch
- Server dry run: `tools/sync_to_server.sh --dry-run`
- Server apply: `tools/sync_to_server.sh --apply --server-dir server-instance`
- Client dry run: `tools/sync_to_client.sh --dry-run --client-dir /path/to/client`
- Client apply: `tools/sync_to_client.sh --apply --client-dir /path/to/client`
- All instances: `tools/sync_all_instances.sh --dry-run --client-dir /path/to/client`
- Bootstrap server: `tools/bootstrap_server.sh --server-dir /tmp/btm-server --port 25566`
- Launch server: `tools/launch_server_direct.sh --server-dir /tmp/btm-server -- nogui`
- Bootstrap client: `tools/bootstrap_client_runtime.sh --client-dir /tmp/btm-client`
- Launch direct client: `tools/launch_client_direct.sh --client-dir /tmp/btm-client --username AgentClient --server 127.0.0.1:25566`
- Direct join probe: `tools/client_join_probe_direct.sh --client-dir /tmp/btm-client --server 127.0.0.1:25566`
- Prism fallback: `tools/launch_prism_instance.sh "Bound to Matter"`

The sync scripts use managed source path lists and excludes for runtime state. Server sync also excludes known client-only mod entries so client-only jars do not enter the dedicated server runtime. Bootstrap scripts resolve current `.pw.toml` downloads into generated server/client roots; use `tools/resolve_packwiz_downloads.mjs --dry-run --pack-root . --target-dir /tmp/btm-server --side server` to inspect that step directly.

## Modular Harnesses
Use the portable harness layer for repeatable runtime tests instead of hand-built local instances.

- Shared mechanics live in `tools/portable_minecraft_harness.py`.
- Scenario scripts, such as `tools/lc_tfth_c2me_dh_stability.py`, should define only:
  - scenario metadata and default run/docs paths,
  - required mod jar patterns,
  - fatal log classifiers,
  - activity signatures,
  - scenario phases and console commands.
- Keep scenario scripts deterministic and disposable. They should create fresh server/client runtimes under `/tmp`, use direct launchers only, and write compact summaries under `docs/<scenario>/<stamp>/summary.{json,md}`.
- Keep bulky raw logs, crash reports, thread dumps, heap info, and generated worlds under the `/tmp` run root. Commit summaries when they are useful evidence; do not commit raw runtime directories.
- Harness scripts are repo tooling, not pack content. `tools/` must stay excluded from packwiz via `.packwizignore`; verify with `rg '^file = "tools/' index.toml` after `packwiz refresh`.
- Do not make a stability harness pass by disabling the feature being tested. Required mods and features must stay enabled unless the user explicitly asks for an exclusion experiment.
- Prefer adding a new scenario wrapper over copying launcher/process code. If a new test needs generic behavior, add it to `portable_minecraft_harness.py` and keep scenario-specific behavior in the scenario file.
- Use `--cycles`, `--idle-seconds`, `--keep-going`, `--keep-runs`, `--min-free-gb`, and `--max-old-runs` to tune validation runs. Default behavior should prune old `/tmp` runs and fail early if free space is low.
- On stalls, timeouts, watchdogs, JVM exits, or crash reports, capture diagnostics through the harness before stopping processes.

Current LC/DH scenario:
- Run: `python3 tools/lc_tfth_c2me_dh_stability.py`
- Short smoke: `python3 tools/lc_tfth_c2me_dh_stability.py --cycles 1 --idle-seconds 30 --tfth-seconds 30`
- Full validation expectation: 3 clean boot/join/LC teleport/DH generation/TFTH pressure cycles, required jars present on server and client, no crash reports, no ModernFix watchdog, no C2ME thread-guard failures, and DH activity observed.

## Core Rules
- Do not invent IDs; mark unknowns as `UNKNOWN`.
- Keep KubeJS Rhino-safe and deterministic (`kubejs:*` IDs).
- Prefer data-driven generation over copy-paste recipes.
- Remove bypasses; do not introduce deadlocks.
- Update docs when progression behavior changes.

## Validate Before Shipping
1. `node --check` for touched JS scripts.
2. Run relevant `tools/` harness/tests.
3. Confirm recipe visibility (EMI/JEI-facing paths).
4. Recheck known chokepoints (alloy, casing, grout, gates, coins/trades).
5. Record findings in `docs/`.

For runtime/tooling changes, also run:
1. `bash -n tools/*.sh`
2. Sync scripts in `--dry-run`
3. Sync scripts in `--apply` against temporary server/client directories
4. Runtime probes against temporary directories when launch assets are available
5. `python3 -m py_compile` for touched Python tools
