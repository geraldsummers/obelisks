# Runtime Validation

## Policy

Raw logs, crash reports, generated worlds, and machine summaries belong in `/tmp`, disposable runtime roots, `server-instance/`, `server-template/`, or `generated/`. Keep `docs/` to concise conclusions and current operating guidance.

Do not treat stale client/server logs or stale jar caches as evidence. Re-sync or re-bootstrap before making runtime claims.

## Agent Entry Points

```bash
tools/btm test static
tools/btm test runtime --instance /path/to/fresh/runtime
tools/btm test runtime --instance /path/to/fresh/runtime --strict-data-dumps
tools/btm test smoke --server-dir /tmp/btm-agent-validate-smoke --port 25565 --reset-runtime
tools/btm test scenario dimension_worldgen --cycles 1 --radius 1 --samples 1
tools/btm test scenario lc_tfth_c2me_dh --cycles 1 --idle-seconds 30 --tfth-seconds 30
tools/btm test kotlin
tools/btm doctor env
tools/btm doctor repo
tools/btm doctor runtime --instance /path/to/fresh/runtime
```

- `--static`: source plus retained generated-dump checks. No fresh runtime claim.
- `--runtime`: strict validation of an existing fresh runtime's logs and KubeJS audit dumps.
- `--strict-data-dumps`: additionally requires vanilla `/dump` output such as `dump/data_raw/loot_tables`; this is separate from KubeJS audit dumps under `kubejs/config`.
- `--smoke`: fresh disposable server bootstrap, boot, hard-log scan, and strict runtime suite.
- `tools/btm test scenario` is the supported front door for harness-backed runtime scenarios.
- `tools/btm doctor ...` is the supported front door for prerequisite, repo-surface, and runtime-shape checks.

Realistic Hands static regressions now cover primitive loose-earth hand breakability, representative knife/sword separation, first-class tool coverage, primitive flint butcher knife and hand axe recipes, Farmer's Delight straw-harvester knife tags, and ore/deepslate hardness probe coverage. The exact deepslate `+1` hardness assertion is enforced when a retained `generated/runtime-dumps/block_hardness_probe.json` exists.

Player progression regressions are data-driven by `kubejs/config/player_progression_regression.json` and enforced by the Kotlin-backed `tools/btm internal validate-player-progression-contracts` path during `--static`. Current coverage includes the primitive tool route, the full machine casing ladder, Blood Magic heart/orb/slate authority, Creating Space dimension routes, and absence of future milestone outputs from starting options, repo loot, Wares loot, generated quest rewards, and villager buy results. Effective recipe graph route reachability still requires a refreshed strict runtime dump.

After changing validation entry points or evidence claims, re-run the relevant `tools/btm test ...` modes and confirm the generated validation report still matches the intended evidence level.

## Routine Checks

For normal content work:

```bash
tools/btm test static
tools/btm doctor repo
```

For runtime-facing content changes:

```bash
tools/btm test runtime --instance /path/to/fresh/runtime
tools/btm test smoke --server-dir /tmp/btm-content-smoke --port 25565 --reset-runtime
```

For toolchain/build changes:

```bash
tools/btm doctor env
tools/btm build sync server --dir /tmp/btm-sync-server --dry-run
tools/btm build sync client --dir /tmp/btm-sync-client --dry-run
tools/btm test kotlin
```

## Runtime Smoke

```bash
tools/btm build sync server --dir server-instance --dry-run
tools/btm build sync server --dir server-instance --apply
tools/btm test smoke --server-dir /tmp/btm-content-smoke --port 25565 --reset-runtime
```

`tools/btm test smoke` bootstraps a fresh server, prunes stale runtime mods, boots the server, scans hard log failures, and runs the strict runtime suite.

## Scenario Harnesses

`tools/btm test scenario` is the supported front door for portable harness scenarios. Scenario runs should create disposable server/client runtimes under `/tmp` and keep raw evidence there.

Older Prism/server-instance profiling tools that mutate live mod directories or kill broad launcher/java processes are guarded by `BTM_ALLOW_LEGACY_LIVE_MUTATION=1`. Use them only for intentional archival profiling; current validation should use disposable runtimes and the portable harness layer.

All-dimension worldgen stress:

```bash
tools/btm test scenario dimension_worldgen --cycles 1 --radius 1 --samples 1
```

Current clean evidence: `/tmp/btm-dimension-worldgen/20260604-215117` passed radius-1 chunk generation in every authored dimension with C2ME, Distant Horizons, and `btmfixes` enabled. The harness treats C2ME far-chunk writes, DH worldgen exceptions, crash reports, watchdogs, internal disconnects, and C2ME thread-guard failures as fatal.

Current LC/DH/C2ME/TFTH scenario:

```bash
tools/btm test scenario lc_tfth_c2me_dh
tools/btm test scenario lc_tfth_c2me_dh --cycles 1 --idle-seconds 30 --tfth-seconds 30
```

Expected full validation: three clean boot/join/space-routed dimension teleport/Distant Horizons generation/TFTH pressure cycles, required jars present, no crash reports, no ModernFix watchdog, no C2ME thread-guard failures, and Distant Horizons activity observed.

## Current Follow-Ups

- Confirm Creating Space travel UI and Earth orbit routes to Lost Cities, Twilight Forest, Fallout Wastelands, Finley, and Call From The Depths.
- Validate long settlement-roads and village-walls generation beyond boot/join.
- Confirm Unearthed/Hyle deepslate replacement in fresh terrain.
- Re-run LC/DH/C2ME/TFTH after mod, config, worldgen, or custom jar changes affecting those systems.
